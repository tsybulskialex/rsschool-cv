## **ABOUT ME**
My name is Alexander. I am 32. I am from Belarus and live in the city Grodno. I've been studying programming for about a year. I started studying Python and then started studying HTML, CSS and JS. I like to see the result of my work on the computer, so this fascinates me. I am quite diligent and flexible in learning and working on something new.
